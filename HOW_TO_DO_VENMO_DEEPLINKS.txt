This is the deeplink syntax: https://venmo.com/<USER_NAME_1>,<USER_NAME_2>...?txn=<charge|pay>&note=<NOTE>&amount=<AMOUNT>

Even after finding this, one of the problems I ran into was that there's no way to a pull the list of a user's friends from Venmo (no API remember?). After poking around a bit I discovered that you can use this link with either a phone number, or an email address and as long as it's associated with the user account who you'd like to charge/pay Venmo will resolve it to their account once they take control. If you don't know any of those three, you can also use a link with NO username and just attach the username in app once you're able to search for it (like this https://venmo.com/?txn=charge&note=pizza&amount=9.34).
Caveat

Venmo no longer allows initiating transactions from their website, so what this does it open a link that the Venmo app has registered on mobile and for which it takes over the experience. If you use these links from a non-mobile device the will take you to the Venmo website but will not allow you to create the transaction.
